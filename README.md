# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a command line application that can take user inputs and generate a full HTML page for the members of a work team. I built this to practice writing tests for javascript classes and test-driven development. It solves the problem of making a nicely formatted and stylized page for members of a work team where you only need to answer a few questions and the hard work is done for you. I learned about writing and using unit tests to build out my javascript classes and code and how to utilize user input to generate a full HTML page using only javascript, node, inquirer and jest.
